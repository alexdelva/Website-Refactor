# Website-Refactor
IN this assignment, i refactored anf redacted the starter code to fit the guidelines and maintain the website that was given.

I consolidated the repeated classes and adequately used the semantic tags to clean up the code and make it more cohesive.

I also made sure the accessiblity problem was fixed, so now all of the links in the toolbar work correctly and as expected.
